Original description :
The Malware Instruction Set (MIST) is a representation for monitored behavior
of malicious software. The representation is optimized for effective and
efficient analysis of behavior using data mining and machine learn- ing
techniques. It can be obtained automatically during analysis of malware with a
behavior monitoring tool or by converting existing behavior reports. The
representation is not restricted to a particular monitoring tool and thus can
also be used as a meta language to unify behavior reports of different sources.
